# DiscordBot

Very first discord bot I made using JDA. 

# Features
!createticket - Creates a new text channel that only staff and the user that made the ticket can see.
!approve - Approve a request that was made in a ticket
!deny - Deny a request that was made in a ticket (Channel will automatically delete in 10 min).

Gives all new users the role "Default". The role must be called "Default" because its just hardcoded in, 
but you can change that.
